Runbook procedures to respond to API Platform alerts. (ATTENTION: Do not store passwords in these procedures)

## Naming Conventions
### Alert Response Runbooks
Name to match the related alert, so they are easy to find.
**Note:** It is always best to include `runbook_url` with all alerts,  so that you can jump directly to the runbook from the alert.  


Suggested format: \<component\>.\<monitored.object.desc\>  
Examples:  
  hooks.process.down


### How To Runbooks
Names should use the format How_To_\<Component\>\_\<Feat_Performed\>.md
