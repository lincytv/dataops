## Introduction

In some cases you may not be able to fix the immediate problem with the IoT Foundation as the issue may be
in one of the components that we do not directly manage (for example, Informix or Cloudant). This page provides some guidance on how to raise issues and callouts on these components.

## Escalating a Cloudant issue

1. Send an e-mail to support@cloudant.com (monitored 24/7)

## Escalating an Informix issue

1. Go to https://bluemix.pagerduty.com
2. Click on the "services" link at the top of the page
3. Click on the "IM Timeseries Database Service"
4. Click the "Manually open a new incident" button and open an alert. Specify that the issue is with the IoT historian. This should notify the DevOps on-call engineers and right folks will get pulled in to resolve the issue.

## Escalating a MessageSight or MessageSight Proxy issue

1. See notes://D06DBL065/8025715E005813BA/4F6DE2D8A32044C485256A2D006A5832/0B7CE5262F9D7DA280257B6D0047064D
2. Notes DB has a table for people working the IMAL3.244 queue and their PERSONAL phones. Please respect that they are their personal phones. 
Attempt to reach any of them on the phone.  Depending on where they are they may or may not be able to help.  No one is permanently on call for MessageSight L3 and so there is no assurance you will actually get through to someone.

## Escalating a SoftLayer issue

1. Raise a SoftLayer ticket at control.softlayer.com

## Escalating an SBS issue

1. See https://releaseblueprints.ibm.com/display/SCE/L2+Support+Process 

## Escalating an SCW issue
