## Duties ##
Monitoring of general behaviour and performance of the production system.
### Security monitoring ###
Use [Dashboard](/docs/ops/sources.html) to see how IoTF is running.
Once a day look at the Security/systematic attack Kibana dashboards and look for changes in the level of suspicious activity. If the rest of the system is behaving unexpectedly, or if the activity is 3 times the usual level of the past week, 
create an incident in RTC. This will be investigated further and be raised at the weekly Ops Review meeting.
If there is evidence of actual intrusion into the system then follow the 
[ITCS 104 security incident reporting process](http://w3-03.ibm.com/transform/sas/as-web.nsf/ContentDocsByTitle/ITCS104+-+Security+Incident+Reporting+and+Management)
