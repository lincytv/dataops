### Issues
For any issues, we would prefer having a ticket raised in [RTC](https://jazzop27.rtp.raleigh.ibm.com:9443/ccm/web/projects/Alchemy#action=com.ibm.team.dashboard.viewDashboard) and filed against `Conductors`. For quick questions, please use [#conductors](https://blue-alchemy.slack.com/messages/conductors/).

### Pull requests
This is the process through which we will accept changes to our codebase. This allows us to review, comment on and change any contributions before merging them into the project.

#### How to create a pull request
1. Fork the project by using the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of the page
2. Clone the project onto your machine - `git clone git@github.ibm.com:<username>/<project_name>.git`
3. Create a separate branch for your changes - `git checkout -b <branch_name>`
4. Push your code
5. When you are happy with your changes, go to your project on Github and click on the green button called "Create, review, compare a pull request"
6. Add an appropriate title and description, and create the pull request!

**Pull request tips**
- If the maintainers ask you to make some changes, you can simply modify your fork of the project and the pull request will be updated.
- Please provide a decent amount of information about what your code fixes/adds to the project.
- If you have more than one commit in your pull request the maintainer can squash your commits together when they perform the merge. This may cause problems with your original branch if you try to merge the upstream repository. It is best practice to delete your branch after the pull request has been merged.
